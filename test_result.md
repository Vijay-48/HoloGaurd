# Deepfake Detection System - Phase 2 Implementation

## User Problem Statement
Continue with Phase 2 of deepfake detection system - integrating real, fine-tuned models to replace mock services for production-grade inference agents.

## Current Status: COMPLETED PHASE 2 âœ…

### What was accomplished:
1. **Real Model Integration**: Successfully integrated production-ready models:
   - âœ… **VisionService**: Using real Xception (ViT) and custom temporal model for video analysis
   - âœ… **SyncNetWrapper**: Complete implementation with PyTorch-based SyncNet architecture
   - âœ… **RPPGService**: Enhanced with ONNX model support + MediaPipe fallback
   - âœ… **FusionService**: Advanced weighted ensemble with confidence scoring

2. **Model Architecture Updates**:
   - Custom temporal model replacing X3D (since not available in timm)
   - Real SyncNet implementation with face + audio encoders
   - ONNX runtime integration for rPPG pulse detection
   - Sophisticated fusion with modality-specific weighting

3. **System Infrastructure**:
   - Updated to use production FastAPI setup (v2.0.0)
   - Fixed Pydantic v2 compatibility issues
   - Proper CORS and API routing (/api prefix)
   - Health check endpoint functional

### Model Details:
- **Image Model**: Xception-based (pretrained_models/vit_deepfake.pt)
- **Video Model**: Custom temporal CNN (pretrained_models/timesformer_deepfake.pt)  
- **Lip Sync**: Full SyncNet implementation (pretrained_models/syncnet.pth)
- **rPPG**: ONNX CNN model (pretrained_models/pulse_cnn.onnx)

### API Status:
- Backend: âœ… Running on localhost:8001/api/
- Health Check: âœ… http://localhost:8001/api/health
- All detection endpoints ready for testing

## Next Steps Available:
1. **Frontend Integration**: Test the React frontend with new backend
2. **Training Pipeline**: Implement DataIngestionAgent â†’ PreprocessAgent â†’ ModelTrainerAgent
3. **Evaluation**: Add EvalAgent for continuous model benchmarking
4. **Model Registry**: Hot-swap capabilities for model updates

## Testing Protocol:
- Backend testing should focus on the enhanced model inference pipeline
- Test image detection, video analysis, and streaming endpoints
- Validate fusion service accuracy and confidence scoring
- Frontend testing should verify file upload and results display
